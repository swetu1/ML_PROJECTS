# Predicting Rate of Interest (ROI) from Bureau Data

## Description
This project aims to address the challenge of predicting the rate of interest (ROI) for various types of loans using data provided by financial bureaus. Financial institutions often face the challenge of incomplete data when making decisions or predictions about loan interest rates. Our project leverages mathematical models and machine learning techniques to estimate the ROI accurately, focusing on loans such as Housing Loans, Property Loans, Business Loans, and Personal Loans.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the rate of interest for loans using a dataset that includes loan details and demographic data of customers. This involves handling incomplete data and extracting valuable insights to inform the prediction model.

## Dataset Overview

### Structure
Briefly describe each file in the dataset:

- `train_main_loan.csv`: Main loan details for the training set, including demographic information.
- `train_all_loan.csv`: Complete credit history for training set IDs.
- `test_main_loan.csv`: Main loan details for the test set.
- `test_all_loan.csv`: Complete credit history for test set IDs.
- `sample_submission.csv`: Format for submitting predictions.

### Preprocessing
Outline the preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, feature engineering, and data normalization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summarize the key insights from your EDA, highlighting patterns and correlations that influenced your model choice and feature engineering.

## Model Building

### Approach
Detail your approach to building the machine learning model, including any specific algorithms, hyperparameter tuning techniques, and the rationale behind your choices.

### Feature Engineering
Explain the process of creating new features and how they contribute to the model's predictive power.

## Results
Discuss the model's performance, including evaluation metrics like RMSE. Highlight both successes and areas for improvement.

## Limitations and Future Work
Acknowledge any limitations of the current model and propose directions for future research or improvements.
